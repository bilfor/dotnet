<p>train cars and fast starts it hold where you want it to. everything trying to kill you can't get to you. oh I know you, not where you are. nothing you say could ever get this far. I'll wake you up when I can't get away. I'll break you down when I don't know what to say.</p>
<p>I felt like my body should break so I broke it up. I tried in the saddest of ways but I fucked it up. I felt it all. tell me honestly, should I become what I deserve? tell me, what do I do when I wake up and can't find you? someday I will be what you want me to be when I'm alone and you can't see when I freak out, when I explode, when I am going crisis mode. when I leave my room I will forget what I should do. if I wanted to change, then I would.</p>
