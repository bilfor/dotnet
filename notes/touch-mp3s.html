    <h2>please let me touch the mp3s</h2>
<h5>2024-03-16</h5>
<p>For when there is no other way to get the mp3 files for an album.</p>
<p>First, install yt-dlp. Install instructions are on the <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp github</a>. Or, on Arch, just:</p>
<p><code>sudo pacman -Syu yt-dlp</code></p>
<p>Navigate wherever you want to put these files. You'll probably want to make a directory to hold them:</p>
<p><code>mkdir album &amp;&amp; cd album</code></p>
<p>Then, run this command with your YouTube URL inserted in the marked place. This can handle a full playlist or just one video, but I'm working with a playlist:</p>
<p><code>yt-dlp --ignore-errors --format bestaudio --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 --audio-quality 160K --output "%(title)s.%(ext)s" --write-thumbnail --convert-thumbnails png 'https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mhV0gG7uk8ScgI_doUdr-Q8qw3jnn9QmM' &amp;&amp; rm *.png</code></p>
<p>Now you have all the files you need (music and cover art), and no more. I really tried to find a way to only download the square jpg from the playlist, but couldn't find it. So, we write the thumbnail of each video as a png, the playlist thumbnail as jpg (don't ask me why it doesn't convert), and we delete the pngs. Wasteful, but clean.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they're not tagged. I like
<a href="https://github.com/NickvisionApps/Tagger">Tagger</a>, which is available in the AUR. </p>
<p><code>yay tagger &amp;&amp; tagger</code></p>
<p>Tagger's GUI is pretty self explanatory. Select your directory to pull up all the songs, then edit them. Note that you can ctrl+click and shift+click the tracklist on the left to edit multiple files at once. It should look something like this when you're all done.</p>

<p>You can share your freshly tagged files on <a href="https://www.slsknet.org/">Soulseek</a> to
save others from having to do the same in the future.
<a href="https://nicotine-plus.org/">Nicotine+</a> is really great, and much easier to use than SoulseekQt.</p>
