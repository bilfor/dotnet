      <p>having nothing to say about anything</p>
      <p>Despite being "too online" from about the age of 10 in 2008, I never seemed to get hooked into the world of blogs. Whether my attention was too fleeting or my interests too undefined, I managed to spend all of my time on forums and aggregator sites like fml, mlia, failbog, and eventually reddit and twitter. Lately, I've been rediscovering the "small web" and with it, the power of a platform that allows an individual complete and total control over the format of their sharing. People like Paul Graham, George Hotz, and Ran Prieur have used these platforms to, if not wide effect, at least potent effect. What I mean by that is that while Ran Prieur might not be a household name, or even relatively notorious on the internet, reading his posts has had a profound effect on me in an extremely short period of time. More than anything, I'm impressed and inspired by his consistency, and the blogging format has allowed him to keep all of this thoughts centered in one place, preserved for anyone who might stumble upon it, and with a signal-to-noise ratio that will not degrade over time.</p>
      <p>More than impressing me, however, these bloggers have hooked me in to their thoughts and opinions. Since there is rarely any bullshit, only posts that are more or less interesting to me, it's much easier to allow these people and their mental models to influence mine in a way that hasn't really opened up to me before. And as I work my way through more and more of their backlog of thoughts and ideas, I realize: comparatively, I have nothing to say about anything.</p>
      <p>Or at least it feels that way. Of course, I have thoughts and opinions about a lot of things. I'm a relatively well-informed and well-educated person. I have a college degree. Iread books and watch documentaries and occasionally check the news. But there seems to be this huge gap between my understanding of a topic and my ability to express myself compared to any of these individuals who I consider to be great (or at least entertaining) contemporary thinkers.</p>
      <p>When someone in my life engages me in a talk about something deeper than surface level, I often find myself frustrated in search of the words to express the ideas in my head. I _know_ how I feel about this issue. I've read pages and pages about it, watched hours of youtube content about it. And yet when I try to relay these facts and opinions to my partner in conversation, I realize that I'm doing just that: relaying. And worse than that, I tend to do a pretty piss-poor job of it. I forget important details. I fail to tie things together. I leave the convesation thinking, well, now they know I'm just a fraud. I had the confidence of someone knowlegable about the topic and I tripped over my shoelaces.</p>
      <p>But it's not just me that does this. It seems that just as often as I find myself at a loss for words, my counterpart does as well. As I expose myself as someone with half-baked ideas, I also realize that my friend's ideas are just as undercooked. We end the conversation with "ah yeah, shit's crazy", or by listing off some poorly threaded points punctuated with an "I don't know".</p>
      <p>How did things get this way? Why are myself and the people around me unable to express ourselves the way that we think we can, or ought to be able to? Social media, over-connectedness, information overload... there are too many potential causes and no control samples among us. Cruelly, this is one of the areas in which I am well-read and yet my ideas spill out of my mouth disappointingly. It seems to me like there's only one potential cure: writing, and to a lesser extent, reading.</p>
