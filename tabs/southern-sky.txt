capo 2


intro:

Am E Fmaj7 C


verse:

Cadd9     G
One, two, three

D       Cadd9             G      D     Cadd9
I count black sheep on my way to sleep

W       W        W            W
I can't pick and choose these devils

W     W                Cadd9
In my patterned dreams

       G       D    Cadd9
When I wake up I am smiling
      
      Am       Em        Cadd9
Now I will not change my mind

W      W    W       W
I will remember the trouble

W     W
In my brother's eye


chorus: 


Am         E            Fmaj7
It's okay, we don't cry

            C
We love the southern sky

Am         E            Fmaj7
It's okay, we don't cry

            C
We love the southern sky

Am         E            Fmaj7
It's okay, we don't cry
 
            C
We love the southern sky

Am         E            Fmaj7
It's okay, we don't cry

            C
We love the southern sky


verse:

Cadd9   G
You and me

D         Cadd9        G      D     Cadd9
These are titles I can hardly speak

W      W          W     W  
Are we bound here to an echo

W      W               Cadd9
Tinted blue and green?

       G   D      Cadd9
Let my memory run backwards

   Am       Em     Cadd9
So together we may lie

W      W    W       W
I will remember the fire
 
W      W        
In the southern sky
